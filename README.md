# BitBucket Branch Management Resource Type

A resource type to do some branch management in a repo via concourse.

Currently, it will do a PR for two existing branches.

---

## Notes and Usage

- To do a PR, both the `to` and `from` PR branches must already exist!
- A token for a BitBucket user is required: Service accounts are recommended. (see Service Account section below)
- You may use a repo in a project OR a repo that belongs to a user. The BitBucket user mentioned above MUST have access to it.
- Other recommendations I would give you would be to use the [built-in Concourse Git Resource Type](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource). Read up on that. You can use the `put` to push local commits to the repo.
- Be mindful when you accept the PRs... you may want to put delete protection on it.. because if the branch doesn't exist anymore, your pipeline won't function.
- Also, if you aren't keeping your branches in step - you are VERY likely to run into conflicts. (A later update to this resource type may help).

> This was created and tested using Atlassian Bitbucket Server v6.7.2.

> It takes advantage of `rest/api/1.0` calls.

> If you are not using the same version that I am, or if your BitBucket admin has certain features limited/turned off -- **please note that your mileage may vary.**

### Additional notes on a Service Account User

- I recommend that you set up a Service Account user in BitBucket for these actions. Once created, set up a token. That will be the token you will use as a var in the pipeline.
- Additional setup for granting the service user access to your project/repo is REQUIRED. Please do that: otherwise, you will not be able to use this pipeline resource tool successfully.
  -In the example below, you will see that I choose to store my secrets in vault, and I employ the use of [spruce](https://github.com/geofffranks/spruce) to implement my secrets. Please do not expose your secrets!
- If you do not know how to do the above steps, please consult someone on your team... I will not be able to assist you with those steps.
